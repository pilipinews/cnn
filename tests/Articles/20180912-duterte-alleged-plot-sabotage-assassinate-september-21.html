DUTERTE BARES ALLEGED PLOT TO 'SABOTAGE,' 'ASSASSINATE' HIM

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 11) - President Rodrigo Duterte said he has learned of plans to remove him from office.

In a one-on-one interview with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo Tuesday, the President said, "Sabi ng ano na, 'yan ang plano nila ngayon. Kung hindi na madala sa paputok-paputok, mag-assassinate. Kaligaya ko na lang mamatay sa kamay ninyo. At least hindi mamatay sa sakit. Ano ba naman 'yang bala? Hindi nga umabot ng isang segundo 'yung tiis mo diyan,"

[Translation: I've heard those were their plans now. If they can't make it happen though explosions, an assassination. I will be glad to die by your hand. At lease I won't die from illness. What's a bullet? Your suffering won't last for even a second.]

The President did not shy away from talking about the alleged plot, instead challenging alleged plotters to continue their plans.

"Umpisahan na ninyo ngayon na. Huwag niyo na patagalin, 'yung plano niyong magsabotage ganoon, sa May... September 21. E di gawain ninyo," he said.

[Translation: Start it now. Don't drag on your plans of sabotage in May.. September 21. Do it.]
