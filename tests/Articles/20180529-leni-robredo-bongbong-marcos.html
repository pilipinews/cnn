ROBREDO ON MARCOS' CLAIM HER APPEAL WAS MISLEADING: 'HE'S LYING'

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, MAY 29) - Vice President Leni Robredo on Tuesday slammed former Senator Bongbong Marcos after he filed a 13-page comment with the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) to junk her appeal to uphold the 25 percent ballot shading threshold during the poll recount.

"Nagsisinungaling siya kasi iyong records will show. In fact, iyong Comelec (Commission on Election) resolution naka-attach ito sa pleading namin," Robredo said.

[Translation: He's lying because the records will show. In fact, we've attached the Comelec resolution in our pleading.]

In his comment filed Monday, Marcos said Robredo's appeal is "misleading," as there is no categorical declaration in the Comelec Resolution No. 16-0600 that the 25 percent shading threshold was adopted by the Comelec En Banc "during the judicial recount and revision of ballots in election protest."

Robredo, however, belied Marcos' claim.

"Hindi iyon totoo. Noong 2010, talagang 50 percent iyong threshold na sinunod, pero iyong 2013, 20 percent. Iyong 2016, 25 percent. Ito, ano naman ito, hindi ito galing sa hangin, pero ito mave-verify ito sa Comelec," she said.

[Translation: That is not true. In 2010, the threshold being followed was really 50 percent, but in 2013, it was 20 percent. In 2016, 25 percent. This is something that was not snatched out of thin air, it can be verified with the Comelec.]

The recount started on April 2, two years after Marcos brought his electoral protest to the Supreme Court, sitting as the PET. He lost to Robredo by 263,473 votes in the 2016 vice presidential race.

In its resolution on April 10, the PET denied Robredo's motion, saying it's not aware of any Comelec resolution that states the applicability of a 25 percent threshold.

It added it cannot treat the Random Manual Audit Guidelines and Report as proof of the threshold used by the Comelec.

The tribunal claimed that it has no basis to impose a 25 percent threshold in determining whether a vote is valid.

But in her urgent motion, Robredo said as early as September 6, 2016, Comelec informed the PET - by way of a letter to then Clerk of the Tribunal Felipa Anama - of the 25 percent threshold used in the May 9, 2016 national and local elections.

The vice president also argued the application of the 50 percent threshold gives the head revisors authority to "reject" her valid votes.

Robredo explained that in the Municipality of Balatan, Barangay Laganac, Clustered Precinct No. 16 - Robredo received 358 votes while Marcos got 17 votes.

However, she pointed out, due to the application of the 50 percent threshold, the votes for Robredo decreased by 12 votes while the votes for Marcos was maintained.

Robredo, however, maintained she is "very confident" that she will still win in the vote recount, saying there was no cheating during the 2016 national elections.
