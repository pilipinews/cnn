ROBREDO, MARCOS PAY ₱50K FINE FOR VIOLATING SC GAG ORDER

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, AUGUST 9) - Vice President Leni Robredo and former Senator Bongbong Marcos have both paid the ₱50,000 fine for violating the gag order issued by the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) on the 2016 poll recount.

Robredo paid the fine on Thursday, according to a statement issued by her lawyer. Marcos paid a day earlier, documents released by his camp showed.

The Supreme Court, standing as the PET, fined Robredo and Marcos on June 26 for violating the sub judice rule, which prohibits parties from publicly discussing the merits of a case pending a court resolution.

However, Robredo's camp said they were merely responding to the "malicious and unfounded public remarks" Marcos made.

The Vice President's lead counsel, Atty. Romulo Macalintal, said their camp "had to act in self-defense" to dispel the malicious statements of Marcos.

The tribunal in April issued a show cause order against them for talking about sensitive information on ballot revisions to the media, and were ordered to observe the rule.

Marcos lost to Robredo by over 263,473 votes in the 2016 vice presidential elections. He claimed fraud in various media briefings, citing anomalies in the ballots.
