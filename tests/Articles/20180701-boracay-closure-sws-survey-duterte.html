64% OF FILIPINOS SUPPORT BORACAY CLOSURE FOR FULL REHAB - SURVEY

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, JULY 1) - A recent Social Weather Services survey showed a majority of Filipinos support the government's move to shut down Boracay Island from tourists for its full rehabilitation.

The non-commissioned survey showed 64 percent of the respondents agreed to close the island destination for a year for its rehabilitation, while 16 percent disagreed and 20 percent of the respondents were undecided.

Boracay has been closed since April 26 for a six-month rehabilitation after government found rampant violations of the environmental laws on the island.

President Rodrigo Duterte earlier called the world-famous tourist destination "a cesspool," and threatened to shut it down permanently if its pollution problem went unsolved.

The survey also revealed 61 percent of Filipinos said the closure would help increase the number of tourists in the future.

"Majorities across socio-demographics agreed with the government's recommendation to close Boracay for one year for full rehabilitation, with stronger support coming from Mindanao, urban areas, and those with higher educational attainment," the SWS said in its report.

Meanwhile, the survey added support for Boracay closure was stronger among those with much trust in Duterte, and those satisfied with him as President and with his administration as a whole.

Conducted from March 23 to 27, 2018, the survey involved 1,200 adults nationwide, with a margin of error of Â±3 for national percentages.
