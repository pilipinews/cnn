UPCAT 2019 NATIONWIDE POSTPONED

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 12) - The country's premier state university has postponed its nationwide admission test in preparation for the possible onslaught of Typhoon Mangkhut.

The University of the Philippines' Office of Admissions on Wednesday announced that the UP College Admission Test (UPCAT) for academic year 2019 will not push through on September 15 to 16.

"This decision is based on consultation with UP System officials and weather experts on the latest forecast on Typhoon Ompong and its expected impact on Northern Luzon and Eastern Seaboard including Western Visayas, and in consideration of the nationwide scope of the exam that entails synchronized travel arrangements among others which pose undue risks to both UPCAT examinees and UPCAT personnel," the University said in its announcement.

UP said it will release a new schedule and instructions for examinees "as soon as possible."

Mangkhut, which will be locally called "Ompong," is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility today, September 12.
