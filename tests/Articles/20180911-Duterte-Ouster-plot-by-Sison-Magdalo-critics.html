DUTERTE: EVIDENCE OF OUSTER PLOT BY SISON, MAGDALO, CRITICS TO BE MADE PUBLIC

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 11) - President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday said the government has evidence of critics' plot to remove him from office and that this will be made public soon.

Duterte said the Communist Party of the Philippines and its exiled founder Joma Sison, the Magdalo group, and other critics were in "constant communication" to unseat him.

"Sison, Magdalo, pati itong mga ayaw sa akin, ang talagang hindi tumanggap sa akin ever since the election - they have combined. And we have the evidence and we have the conversation provided by a foreign country sympathetic to us," Duterte said in a one-on-one interview with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Sal Panelo.

"Any day now, I'll ask that it be declassified," he added. This is the latest of Duterte's public statements that forces are plotting his ouster.

He dared members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to conspire with the Magdalo group led by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, if they think the solider-turned-lawmaker did something for them.

"I urge you to go to Trillanes. Kung nakita niyong may ginawa si Trillanes para sa inyo, go to them and stage a mutiny or revolution of whatever," he said.

He also dared Magdalo to start moving for his ouster now.

"I am challenging Magdalo to start now. Sigurado ninyo na inyo ang sundalo, fine," he said.

Trillanes earlier denied working with communists and Duterte's critics to oust the President, even saying Duterte was only "paranoid." Duterte also linked the Liberal Party to his ouster plot, a claim that was refuted by Vice President Leni Robredo.

Trillanes earlier said members of the AFP were supporting him in his fight against the voidance of his amnesty, and even gave him documents to support his claim he indeed filed for his amnesty.

Trillanes and Magdalo soldiers who were involved in three mutiny attempts against former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo - Oakwood mutiny in July 2003, the Marines stand-off in February 2006, and the Manila Peninsula incident in 2007. They were granted amnesty by the administration of former President Benigno Aquino III in 2011.

Duterte, in his Proclamation 572, invalidated Trillanes amnesty, saying it was void from the beginning saying he did not comply with the requirements.
