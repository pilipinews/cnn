DUTERTE SAYS TRILLANES' AMNESTY REMAINS VOID, BUT HE IS NOT INTERESTED TO ARREST THE SENATOR

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 13) - President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday insisted that Senator Antonio Trillanes IV's amnesty remains void, but that he is not interested in arresting the oppostion lawmaker without an arrest warrant from a court.

"Whether amnesty or pardon, it is only the President (who can sign). Maski anong sabihin mo. Whether it was in the right form," he told reporters after attending a command conference.

Duterte has been insisting that the amnesty Trillanes received in 2011 for his involvement in three mutinies as a Navy officer was signed by then Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin when it should have been signed by then President Benigno Aquino III.

The President also said nobody is interested in arresting Trillanes, one of his staunchest critics.

He also said that his car was tailed. He has been staying at the Senate since Sep.4, when Duterte's Proclamation 572 voiding his amnesty was published.

"Nobody is interested to arrest them. The military does not have interest. I do not have interest. He can stay there as a boarder," Duterte said, adding that he told the police not to arrest Trillanes until there is an arrest warrant from the court.
