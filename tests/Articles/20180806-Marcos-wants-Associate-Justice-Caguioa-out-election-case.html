MARCOS SEEKS INHIBITION OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CAGUIOA IN POLL PROTEST CASE

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, AUGUST 6) - Former Senator Bongbong Marcos filed a motion before the Supreme Court asking to inhibit Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa from his poll protest case versus Vice President Leni Robredo.

In an urgent motion filed Monday, the Marcos camp sought for 'immediate inhibition' of ponente or member-in-charge Justice Caguioa from participating in all proceedings related to the 2016 vice presidential election protest case.

The former senator cited Caguioa's 'close ties' with friend and former boss Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III as a basis of inhibition, saying the Justice 'cannot deny that he is biased with the yellow brigade.'

He added it was public knowledge that Caguioa is a childhood friend and former classmate of Aquino.

Marcos also claimed Caguioa's wife 'was and is still an ardent supporter' of Vice President Robredo, and even actively campaigned for the latter in the 2016 elections.

In a statement, the former senator's camp also revealed a series of online messages from Caguioa's wife which prompted him to push through with the motion.

The messages allegedly 'depicted the wife's resentment' towards Marcos and his family, the statement added.

In July, the Supreme Court, acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), sided with Robredo's appeal and pushed for the 25 percent shading threshold in the recount of votes of the vice presidential race.

Marcos, in the 13-page document, noted that any kind of due process will be meaningless 'if the ultimate decision would come from a partial and biased judge.'

"Given the fact that the Supreme Court is a collegial body, it would be unfair and unjust for the other members of this esteemed Tribunal to be tainted by the impropriety of Associate Justice Caguioa," Marcos said. "

"Consequently, it is imperative that he inhibit himself from participating in the proceedings and deliberations relative to this election protest," he added.
