TYPHOON 'MANGKHUT' TO ENTER PH WEDNESDAY NOON

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 12) - The strong typhoon expected to bring heavy rainfall to parts of Luzon will arrive in the country in a few hours, weather officials reported.

The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said Northern Luzon and Central Luzon should brace for strong winds and heavy rains as typhoon "Mangkhut" is expected to enter Philippine territory Wednesday noon.

PAGASA said Mangkhut has slowed down but gained strength and will traverse Northern Luzon, passing Cagayan and Batanes on Saturday but residents will experience heavy rainfall by Friday.

Weather forecaster Robert Sawi assured that the incoming typhoon will be weaker than super typhoon Haiyan or Yolanda, which claimed thousands of lives and destroyed billions of pesos worth of assets in 2013.

However, he clarified that they are not ruling out the possibility of Mangkhut becoming a super typhoon.

PAGASA defines a super typhoon as a weather disturbance carrying more than 220 kilometers per hour (kph) of maximum center winds. Mangkhut currently has 200 kph center winds and 245 kph gusts. Yolanda brought center winds averaging 235 kph.

A typhoon may bring widespread damage such as uprooted trees and damage to infrastructure, according to PAGASA's forecast.

Mangkhut is expected to leave the country by Sunday. It is currently moving west at 20 kph.

Meanwhile, monsoon rains continue to pour over Palawan, Western Visayas and Mindanao, PAGASA added.
