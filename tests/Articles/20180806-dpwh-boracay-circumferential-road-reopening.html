DPWH: BORACAY CIRCUMFERENTIAL ROAD TO BE PASSABLE IN TIME FOR ISLAND REOPENING

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, AUGUST 6) - The Boracay Circumferential Road will be passable in time for the reopening of the island in October, according to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

In a statement on Monday, Secretary Mark Villar said the rehabilitation of Boracay's main road network is "almost 40 percent complete."

"We have started the pouring of concrete and installation of pipes along Cagban to Elizalde Compound," he was quoted as saying.

The construction of the missing gap stretching from Barangay Manoc-Manoc to Barangay Yapak, meanwhile, is "60 percent [complete]," Villar added.

The whole stretch will have 204-lineal meter reinforced concrete pipe culvert with five catchment basins, 22-lineal meter cross drain, and 130-lineal meter cut-off wall for installation of curb and gutter.

This, according to the Secretary, will help facilitate travel around Puka Beach, one of the most popular portions of the island.

The DPWH is also constructing a road network along Bulabog Beach that will serve as an alternate route while the main road is being rehabilitated.

"This shall also serve as a logistics corridor wherein goods can be transported to and from Boracay Island thus alleviating traffic congestion along the main road, " Villar said.

The rehabilitation of the Boracay Circumferential Road is among the DPWH's priorities during Boracay's six-month closure. The Department aims to expand the current six- to eight-meter road to 12 meters with two lanes, drainage, sidewalks, gutters, and a bike lane.

Boracay has been off limits to local and foreign tourists since April after President Rodrigo Duterte approved a recommendation of the Environment, Interior and Local Government, and Tourism Departments to close the island.
