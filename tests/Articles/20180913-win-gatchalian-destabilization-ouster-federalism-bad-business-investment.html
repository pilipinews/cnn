SENATOR: TALK OF DESTABILIZATION, FEDERALISM IS BAD FOR BUSINESS

METRO MANILA (CNN PHILIPPINES, SEPTEMBER 13) - Senate Economic Affairs Chairman Win Gatchalian is concerned about how talk of alleged destabilization plots against the President will affect investments.

"Talks about destabilization, coups d'etat, even federalism - create this atmosphere of instability that we don't want," Gatchalian told CNN Philippines' The Source. "All of this talk might create a negative environment that will lead to uncertainty for our business sector."

Earlier this month, President Rodrigo Duterte claimed that the opposition was teaming up with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) for a supposed ouster plot (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/08/Rodrigo-Duterte-ouster-plot-Liberal-Party-Antonio-Trillanes-communists.html). Vice President Leni Robredo has since denied this (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/09/robredo-liberal-party-communists-duterte-ouster-plot.html), and opposition lawmaker Antonio Trillanes dismissed the President as "paranoid." (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/09/duterte-trillanes-paranoid-ouster-liberal-party-alejano-robredo.html) CPP founder Joma Sison said that while the left would like to oust Duterte, they are not conniving with any other groups (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/12/Duterte-ouster-destabilization-CPP-Joma-Sison-Trillanes-Magdalo-Liberal-Party.html) to do so.

Duterte said that he would publicize proof against his detractors. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana affirmed (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/11/Duterte-Ouster-plot-by-Sison-Magdalo-critics.html) communists were planning an ouster - but could not verify that opposition lawmakers were linked to it.

Gatchalian stopped short directly criticizing the President, but said "uncertainty" surrounding these issues was bad for business.

The senator enumerated what he called "good news" like lower unemployment and higher foreign direct investments, both of which could be affected by an unstable political climate.

"Many of the credit rating agencies have already flagged this," said Gatchalian. "Kung may [If there is] uncertainty, there's a very big risk that your credit rating might go down. That will affect us also."

There was also talk of possible resistance to Duterte among the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In a tete-a-tete with Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on Tuesday, the President enumerated what he said were pro-military policies - like the provision of new arms from Russia and raising the salaries of soldiers. He then goaded those who were still sympathetic to Trillanes to stage a coup (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/12/Duterte-challenge-military-ouster-plot.html) against him. Lorenzana denied (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/09/10/Duterte-destabilization-plot-Trillanes-military-Liberal-Party.html) anyone in the military was plotting against Duterte.

Apart from destabilization rumors, Duterte's administration is also working on a shift to federalism, which faces an uphill battle in the Senate. Economic managers have expressed reservations (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/08/08/Even-the-Finance-Chief-is-confused-with-shift-to-federalism.html) to the cost of charter change, while senators are wary (http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/08/01/senator-ping-lacson-charter-change-dead-senate-arroyo-house.html) as former President-turned-House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo champions the shift.
